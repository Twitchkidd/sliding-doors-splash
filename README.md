# Sliding Doors Splash Screen Experiment!

I want to see if I can make something like something I saw doing Saeed's research where they did page transistions by sliding whole screen divs in a sequence of shades and tints in, in like a stack thing. It was beautiful.

I'm thinking like eigengrau on top, slide that out and reveal tints of maroon until getting to regular maroon and then having the title in white, having it pause for a sec, then do another quick sequence of slides to white and then having the title fade in up top in maroon and then having the rest of the page content fade in. Ooo, and on desktop, similar except probably more of like a fade until maroon and have the maroon title just not fade, then when the background is white, translate and scale the title into place. Dooope.

I'm definitely going to have to look things up when it comes to animation time, let's get the static screens!

Post-first actually good commit! Nice! I feel like the animation would be better with a couple more tints of maroon
